# Task
The task of this project is to create a React application that allows users to explore information about 

various Pokémon. The application will utilize the PokéAPI to fetch data about different Pokémon species, 

such as their names, images, abilities, stats, and other relevant details. 

The main objective is to present this data in an organized and visually appealing manner, 

making it easy for users to navigate and search for specific Pokémon.

# Description
The Pokémon application is a simple React-based web app that provides a user-friendly interface for 

exploring details about different Pokémon. It leverages the power of the PokéAPI, 

which serves as a comprehensive database containing information about numerous Pokémon species.

Upon launching the application, users will be presented with a list of Pokémon. 

Each Pokémon in the list will be represented by a card that displays its name, an image, and basic information. Users can scroll through the list to view different Pokémon and get an overview of their details.

The app also includes a search functionality, allowing users to find specific Pokémon by entering their 

names in the search bar. The search feature uses a filter to match the search query with the names of Pokémon 

in the list, making it easy to locate specific Pokémon quickly.

When users click on a Pokémon card from the list or the search results, 

they will be taken to a detailed page dedicated to that specific Pokémon. 

The detailed page provides more comprehensive information, including a larger image of the Pokémon, 

its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed),
 
abilities, and other relevant data.
